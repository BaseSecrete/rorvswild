# Changelog of RorVsWild

## Unreleased

* Instrument ActiveSupport cache
* Read deployment's revision from $KAMAL_VERSION

## 1.9.1 (2025-02-20)

* Fix instrumentation when rendering an empty collection
* Hide line number from local profiler when it is not relevant (view, GC, ..)
* Fix error from local profiler when keys are not symbolized

## 1.9.0 (2025-01-20)

* Measure ActiveRecord async queries and displays the non blocking time
* Measure render collection
* Requests now report the time they have been queued by the proxy before reaching the application.

  A section with the kind `queue` reports the time between the timestamp set by the HTTP proxy
  when the request was received and the time the application started processing the request.

  This time is also included into the total runtime of the request.

## 1.8.1 (2024-10-17)

* Hide widget does not inject anything in HTML response
* Fix Set#join undefined method since it has been added from Ruby 3.0

## 1.8.0 (2024-06-14)

* Measure easily any Ruby method:

  ```ruby
  class Model
    def self.foo
      # ...
    end

    def bar
      # ...
    end

    RorVswild.measure(method(:foo))
    RorVswild.measure(instance_method(:bar))
  end
  ```

* Time garbage collector

  A section with the kind `gc` measures how long the GC ran during a request or a job.
  All GC executions are added together in a single section.
  For each section, the time spent in the GC is substracted.

  It might not be listed for all requests and jobs, since the GC is triggered when Ruby is running out of memory.
  You can force that in development by calling `GC.start`.

  From Ruby 3.1 it is enabled by default via and the agent uses `GC.total_time`.
  Before Ruby 3.1 the agent uses `GC::Profiler.total_time` and it must be enabled with `GC::Profiler.enable`.

* Store requests, jobs and errors into the local profiler

  Even after restarting the server, past requests, jobs and error are still viewable from the local profiler.
  Upto the last 100 entries are stored per type.
  They are stored into JSON files located in tmp directory.

## 1.7.1 (2024-06-03)

* Fix DelayedJob name and args for ActiveJob wrappers
* Limit server timing header to 10 entries
* Print ASCII server timing in logs
* Improve widget UI

## 1.7.0 (2024-04-22)

* Sample requests and jobs to lower our customers' bills

  These parameters should be used by large volume applications only.
  When the volume is significant, sending more does not improve precision and sending less does not decrease it.
  More precisely, for a large volume of requests but a low volume of jobs, it makes sens to sample requests only.

  ```yaml
  # config/rorvswild.yml
  production:
    api_key: API_KEY
    job_sampling_rate: 0.5 # 50% of jobs are sent
    request_sampling_rate: 0.25 # 25% of requests are sent
  ```

* Add Server-Timing headers

  Server-Timing is a HTTP header to provide metrics about backend runtimes.
  It's disabled by default, and it has to be enabled for each request.
  You will probably prefer to limit to privileged users in production to prevent from exposing sensitive data.
  Here is a good default setup, to enable server timing in all environments and only for admins in production:

  ```ruby
  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    before_action :expose_server_timing_headers

    def expose_server_timing_headers
      # Assuming there are current_user and admin? methods
      RorVsWild.send_server_timing = !Rails.env.production? || current_user.try(:admin?)
    end
  end
  ```

## 1.6.5 (2024-04-18)

* Fix issue #28 when for Rodauth authentication

## 1.6.4 (2024-01-12)

* Change default open timeout to 10 seconds
* Open files in your text editor by clicking from the local widget

  It should be set with an env variable when developers are not using the same editor.

  ```yaml
  # config/rorvswild.yml
  development:
    # VSCode: vscode://file${path}:${line}
    # Sublime: subl://${path}:${line}
    editor_url: <%= ENV.fetch("RORVSWILD_EDITOR_URL", "vscode://file${path}:${line}") %>
